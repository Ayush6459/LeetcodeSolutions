identification of Sliding Window Problems :
    -> input will be arrays or strings 
    -> will ask about some subarrays or substrings
    -> along with that it will ask to find about somethings largest or minimum with a given window size of K

Two types : 
    1. Fixed Size window 
    2. Variable Size window
    

variable size formate:

    while j<len:
        calculation
        if condition<k:
            j+=1
        elif condition == k:
            ans <- calculation
            J+=1
        elif condition>k:
            while condition>k:
                remove calculation for i 
                i+=1
            j+=1
    return ans
